My projects from 1 to 4 were done in a group of 4 people during the first semester of college, in the Analysis and Systems Development / Software Engineering program.
For each project, we added more features to make the point-of-sale system for Berenice's bakery complete by the end of the semester. 
These projects were developed in the C language, and personally, I ensured the maximum grade for the project and presentations.
This achievement was the result of individual and collective effort from each group member. 
I will include the requirements in Brazilian Portuguese for each project in their respective folders. 
I hope you like them.
